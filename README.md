# BIO2_Symposium_Poster_2024
### INTRODUCTION
Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium species that frequently contaminates corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice, which affects the health of livestock consuming the DON-contaminated feed. 


Some bacterial species have been recently discovered to have the ability to transform DON into a safer alternative. 


Discovery of novel enzymes originating from these bacteria offers potential effective and eco-friendly detoxification solutions.
### METHOD
A workflow will be designed to analyze RNA sequencing data from bacteria expressing detoxification enzymes.
- Data will be preprocessed to allow for prokaryotic compatibility with the nf-core stage
- Extensive annotation will allow for in-depth enrichment and pathway analysis
- Alphafold2 will be used to generate protein structures for differentially expressed genes of interest


Workflow will be implemented in the Nextflow system to maximize efficiency through the use of parallel computing resources


Utilize containers to ensure data is processed in consistent software environments, allowing for the generation of reproducible results.
